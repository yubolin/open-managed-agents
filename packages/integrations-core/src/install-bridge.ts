// to know whether the host calls back through a CF service binding or runs
// the install in-process.
//
// CF impl: wraps the existing INTEGRATIONS service binding + MAIN RPC
// surfaces (cf-install-bridge in apps/main).
// Node impl: direct in-process — imports the same providers + services that
// CF used to reach via the binding (node-install-bridge in apps/main-node).
//
// Method surface is intentionally small. Anything more provider-specific
// stays inside the provider package (e.g. LinearProvider.continueInstall);
// the bridge only owns the cross-cutting bits a route needs to pick the
// right provider, lookup session-bound creds, and mint App-JWT-derived
// tokens for GitHub Apps.
