// Service container — one canonical surface for all platform-agnostic
// services in OMA.
//
// Why this exists:
//   - Wiring decision (D1 vs Postgres vs SQLite vs in-memory) lives in ONE
//     place — the buildXxxServices factories below. Routes / DOs / cron all
//     depend on the `Services` interface; swapping deployment = swap factory.
//   - HTTP routes pick services off `c.var.services` (Hono request scope).
//   - DO / outbound worker / cron / anything outside Hono builds its own
//     instance via the same factory. Same `Services` type, no duplication.
//   - Tests use a TenantDbProvider fake plus the same factory.
//
// Adding a new store:
//   1. Add `<storeName>: <ServiceType>` to the `Services` interface
//   2. Add construction call to each `buildXxxServices` (CF + future Node + tests)
//   3. Consumers reference `c.var.services.<storeName>` (HTTP) or
//      `services.<storeName>` (everywhere else). No import changes anywhere.
//
// Per-tenant DB routing (Phase 1+):
//   - `buildCfServices(env, db)` takes a resolved D1Database — every adapter
//     constructed inside reads/writes against that one DB.
//   - The DB is resolved per-request by the new `tenantDbMiddleware`, which
//     calls `TenantDbProvider.resolve(tenantId)` after authMiddleware sets
//     `c.var.tenant_id`. Phase 1 default returns the shared `env.MAIN_DB`
//     for every tenant — zero behaviour change. Phase 4 swaps in the
//     static-binding resolver.
//
// The self-host escape hatch:
//   - Today only `buildCfServices` exists.
//   - When self-hosting on Node + Postgres becomes a real target, add a
//     `buildNodeServices(opts: { pg, ... })` that returns the same `Services`
//     shape from Postgres adapters. Entry file picks one based on env.
//   - Routes and business code don't change at all.
