# Self-host OMA — single-process Node deployment

A Node-side build of Open Managed Agents that runs on a single VPS / Mac /
Docker host without any Cloudflare account, Workers, Durable Objects, or
Containers. Storage is SQLite or Postgres + local filesystem. Sandboxes
are local subprocesses by default; switch to E2B for Firecracker isolation
when you're past trusted-developer territory.

> **One of three deployment topologies.** See [deployment.md](./deployment.md)
> for the full Self-host / CF Local / CF Prod comparison + decision
> matrix. This doc covers Self-host specifically.

> **Status:** Working PoC. The self-host route is a parallel implementation of
> the same `Services` abstractions used on Cloudflare, including better-auth
> multi-tenant. See "What works / doesn't" below.

## Choose a backend

One image, two compose files — pick the one that matches your durability
& concurrency story. You can switch later (see [Migrating between
backends](#migrating-between-backends) below).

| | SQLite + LocalFs (default) | Postgres + LocalFs |
|---|---|---|
| Compose file | `docker-compose.yml` | `docker-compose.postgres.yml` |
| Best for | Single-user self-host, dev, demo, ≤10 GB sessions | Multi-instance, ≥50M sessions/events rows, share existing PG |
| Concurrency | One writer (single oma-server) | Many writers; HA-able |
| Backups | `cp ./data/*.db` or [litestream](https://litestream.io) → S3 | `pg_dump` / managed PG snapshots |
| Extra services | None | + `postgres:16-alpine` (or external PG) |
| When to switch | "I want PG already" / "want to scale out" | — |

**Same Docker image either way** (`openma/main-node:dev` built from
`apps/main-node/Dockerfile`) — `DATABASE_URL` env at runtime decides.
SQLite needs only `DATABASE_PATH`; Postgres needs `DATABASE_URL=
postgres://…`. In Postgres mode better-auth's tables live in the same
PG database (no separate `auth.db` file); in SQLite mode they live in
`./data/auth.db`.

## Quick start (Docker, SQLite)

```bash
# 1. Get an Anthropic API key. Any Anthropic-compatible endpoint works.
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env  # set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# 2. Start (first time builds the image; subsequent runs skip --build)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build

# 3. Sanity check
curl localhost:8787/health
# → {"status":"ok","runtime":"node","backends":{"db":"sqlite ..."},...}

# 4. Create + drive an agent
AID=$(curl -s -X POST localhost:8787/v1/agents \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"shell","model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","system":"Use bash to answer.","tools":[{"type":"bash"}]}' \
  | jq -r .id)

SID=$(curl -s -X POST localhost:8787/v1/sessions \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"agent_id\":\"$AID\"}" | jq -r .id)

# Open a streaming SSE in one terminal:
curl -N localhost:8787/v1/sessions/$SID/events/stream &

# Send a message in another:
curl -s -X POST localhost:8787/v1/sessions/$SID/events \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"events":[{"type":"user.message","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Run: ls -la / | head"}]}]}'

# Watch the SSE — you should see agent.tool_use → agent.tool_result →
# agent.message → session.status_idle
```

Subsequent commands:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml logs -f   # follow logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml down       # stop, keep ./data
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml down -v    # stop, wipe volumes
```

## Quick start (no Docker)

```bash
pnpm install
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... pnpm --filter @open-managed-agents/main-node start
# Same curl flow as above against localhost:8787.
```

State lives at `./data/` (sqlite db + per-session sandbox workdirs).
Wipe + restart for a clean slate.

## Postgres backend

When to flip to Postgres: multi-instance, large tables (50M+ rows on
sessions/events), or because you'd rather operate the PG cluster you
already have than introduce a new SQLite footprint.

```bash
# 1. Same .env (Postgres compose already sets DATABASE_URL internally)
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env  # set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# 2. Start — brings up postgres:16-alpine + oma-server + oma-vault
docker compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d --build

# 3. Sanity check — note backends.db reports postgres
curl localhost:8787/health
# → {"status":"ok","backends":{"agents":"postgres","events":"postgres","db":"postgres ..."},...}
```

Curl flow + console URL are identical — application code is backend-
agnostic. Same `openma/main-node:dev` image, just different env.

What changes vs the SQLite stack:

- `oma-server` reads `DATABASE_URL=postgres://oma:oma@postgres:5432/oma`
  (set in `docker-compose.postgres.yml`); the same SqlClient port serves
  every store package, so business code is identical.
- `oma-vault` follows the same dispatch — when `DATABASE_URL` is a
  postgres URL the sidecar reads credentials from PG (otherwise it falls
  back to the bundled SQLite path). The two services MUST agree on the
  backend or vault credential injection won't see anything to inject.
- A `postgres:16-alpine` service ships with the compose, persisted on a
  named volume `oma-pgdata`. No host port published; only `oma-server`
  reaches it on the bridge network. Add `ports: ["5432:5432"]` if you
  want `psql` access from the host.
- **better-auth runs on the same Postgres database.** No separate
  `auth.db` file; the `user` / `session` / `account` / `verification`
  tables sit alongside `agents`, `sessions`, `tenant`, etc. and are
  bootstrapped at first start (idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
  with PG-native `boolean` / `timestamptz` types). Internally we open
  a small `pg.Pool` (max 10) for better-auth's kysely PostgresDialect
  — the main store stays on `postgres.js`. `AUTH_DATABASE_PATH` is
  ignored in PG mode.

### Running multiple oma-server replicas (PG mode only)

PG mode supports >1 `oma-server` process behind a load balancer. SSE
fanout works across replicas: every `append` issues `NOTIFY
oma_session_events '{sid,seq}'` on a shared PG channel, and every
replica `LISTEN`s on the same channel. When replica B receives a NOTIFY
for a session it has a local SSE writer for, it fetches `seq >
lastForwarded` from the SQL log and pushes the new events to its
writer. Local round-trip latency is typically <100 ms; we measure ~2 ms
on a same-host PG and ~80 ms via curl through two `pnpm start`
processes.

**`/auth/*` is also replica-safe** in PG mode: better-auth's tables
live in the shared Postgres, so any replica can serve any auth
request. No sticky sessions required.

Hard requirements before you scale out:

1. **Memory blob storage MUST be shared across replicas.** Two paths
   work:
   - **Local NFS / EFS / shared docker volume + chokidar** — bind the
     same `MEMORY_BLOB_DIR` into every replica. Each replica runs its
     own chokidar watcher; concurrent watchers firing for the same
     write are no-ops past the first because `upsertFromEvent` is
     idempotent on `(store_id, path)` + sha256 etag.
   - **S3 / S3-compatible bucket** — set `MEMORY_S3_*` env vars (see
     "S3-backed memory store" below). main-node switches to the
     `S3BlobStore` adapter and a per-store-leased `S3PollAdapter`
     replaces chokidar. Multi-replica safe by construction (only the
     lease holder polls a given store at a time).
2. **`oma-vault` is stateless and can also replicate.** It's a
   per-request DB lookup + header inject — no caches, no per-process
   state beyond the on-disk CA. To run N copies, mount the same
   `OMA_VAULT_CA_DIR` into every replica (the first one to boot
   generates `ca.{crt,key}` under an O_EXCL `ca.lock`; the others
   wait+read), put a Service / LB in front, and set
   `OMA_VAULT_PROXY_URL=http://oma-vault:14322` (or your LB DNS) on
   sandboxes. **Constraint:** all vault replicas MUST share the same
   CA key — sandboxes that trust one CA but get TLS-terminated by a
   replica with a different CA will see cert errors. The shared
   `./data/oma-vault-ca` volume + lock-on-create handles this.
   `docker-compose.postgres.yml` ships with a commented
   `deploy.replicas: 3` example on the `oma-vault` service.

Sticky cookies are NOT required for `/v1/*`, `/auth/*`, or outbound
sandbox traffic — the SSE fanout is replica-agnostic, better-auth is
on the shared PG, and the vault is stateless.

### S3-backed memory store (multi-replica friendly)

When `MEMORY_S3_ENDPOINT` + `MEMORY_S3_BUCKET` + `MEMORY_S3_ACCESS_KEY`
+ `MEMORY_S3_SECRET_KEY` are all set, main-node swaps the
`LocalFsBlobStore` for an S3-compatible `S3BlobStore` (works against
AWS S3, MinIO, Tigris, Wasabi, Cloudflare R2's S3 API, etc.) and
starts an `S3PollAdapter` that lists the bucket every
`MEMORY_S3_POLL_INTERVAL_SEC` (default 30) for new/changed objects.
Sandbox sides (Daytona / E2B) already mount the bucket via s3fs using
the same env vars; the loop "agent writes via FUSE → S3 PUT → poller
upserts SQL index" is the multi-replica analog of the chokidar path.

Limitation: `local-subprocess` sandboxes still need
`MEMORY_BLOB_DIR` for their `/mnt/memory` symlinks — the local subprocess
adapter doesn't speak s3fs. Use S3 mode together with a remote sandbox
provider. Inside the `openma/main-node` container the adapter creates a
real `/mnt/memory/<storeName>` symlink (visible to bash that hardcodes
the path); on hosts without a writable `/mnt`, it transparently rewrites
`/mnt/memory/...` to the workdir-relative `.mnt/memory/...` so harness
read/write/edit/glob/grep tools still land on the right files.

### Pointing at an existing Postgres cluster

To use a managed PG (RDS / Neon / Supabase / your own cluster) instead
of the bundled `postgres` service, drop the `postgres` service block
from `docker-compose.postgres.yml` and override `DATABASE_URL` in
`.env`:

```bash
# .env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pw@my-pg.internal:5432/oma_prod
# OMA_VAULT_DATABASE_URL=...   # if you want the vault sidecar to use a different DB
```

The schema bootstraps on first start (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
across all 13 tables); no separate migration step. Re-running is safe.

### Migrating between backends

Switching directions in either direction means moving rows; no
in-place upgrade. Two paths:

**SQLite → Postgres (one-way).** Spin up the PG stack pointed at a
fresh DB. Then export from SQLite + import via `psql`:

```bash
# SQLite side
sqlite3 ./data/oma.db ".dump agents agent_versions sessions session_events session_streams memories memory_stores memory_versions vaults credentials session_memory_stores tenant membership" > /tmp/oma-dump.sql
# Strip SQLite-specific pragmas (BEGIN/COMMIT survive; PRAGMA / sqlite_sequence don't)
sed -i '/^PRAGMA\|sqlite_sequence/d' /tmp/oma-dump.sql
# PG side
docker exec -i oma-postgres psql -U oma -d oma < /tmp/oma-dump.sql
```

`agent.id`, `session.id` etc. are TEXT, BIGINT timestamps work in both,
JSON columns are TEXT not jsonb — no schema translation needed beyond
the pragma strip.

**Postgres → SQLite (one-way).** Less common, but possible: `pg_dump
--inserts --data-only` + a sed pass to `INSERT OR REPLACE`, then
`sqlite3 oma.db < dump.sql`. Auth.db is unaffected (already SQLite on
both sides).

### Backups & operations

| | SQLite + LocalFs | Postgres + LocalFs |
|---|---|---|
| Hot backup | [litestream](https://litestream.io) replicates `./data/*.db` to S3 continuously | `pg_dump` cron / managed PG snapshots / WAL streaming |
| Restore | Stop server, copy db back, restart | `pg_restore` into fresh PG, point `DATABASE_URL` at it |
| Sandbox workdirs | Always on local FS — back up `./data/sandboxes/` separately | Same |
| Memory blobs | `./data/memory-blobs/` — back up separately or set `MEMORY_S3_*` (s3fs mount) | Same |
| auth.db | Always SQLite — back up `./data/auth.db` | Same |

Both backends pass the same crash-recovery test surface (55 tests across
adapter / recovery-logic / SIGKILL bootstrap / CF DO eviction).

## Operator gotchas

Things I'd document if I were the on-call who got paged:

- **`AUTH_DISABLED=1` must be in `.env`, not the shell.** `docker
  compose` substitutes `${AUTH_DISABLED}` from the compose-time env
  (your `.env` at the compose dir). Putting it in the shell only is
  silently ignored.
- **`docker compose restart` does NOT re-read env.** After editing
  `.env`, use `docker compose up -d --force-recreate oma-server` to
  pick up changes (or `down` then `up`).
- **`agent.system` defaults to empty.** The Anthropic API rejects
  `system: [{type:"text", text:""}]` — main-node passes `undefined`
  when system is empty. If you ever see "system: text content blocks
  must be non-empty", your model proxy is stricter than the SDK
  expects. Set a non-empty `system` on the agent.
- **`tools=8` even when you set `tools:[]` on the agent.** main-node's
  `buildTools` always wires the harness's standard set (bash, read,
  write, edit, glob, grep, web_fetch, web_search). Per-agent tool
  filtering happens at routing time, not at build time. To disable a
  tool entirely, omit it from `agent.tools`; the harness will see it
  but never invoke it.
- **`oma-vault` won't see PG credentials if you set `DATABASE_URL`
  on `oma-server` only.** Both services share the same store; if you
  want vault credential injection on PG, both must point at PG. The
  PG compose handles this for you; if you customise, mirror the env.
- **First boot from an old `oma.db`.** The unified-runtime refactor
  added two columns to `sessions` (`turn_id`, `turn_started_at`).
  main-node runs `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN` idempotently on every
  start; existing dbs upgrade in place. If you see `no such column:
  turn_id`, you're on a pre-migration build — pull a newer image.

## Crash recovery demo

OMA's self-host mode persists session state to SQLite + the event log on
every write, so a `kill -9` on the Node process doesn't lose the
conversation.

```bash
# 1. Create a session, drop in a few messages.
SID=$(curl -s -X POST localhost:8787/v1/sessions -d '{}' | jq -r .id)
for i in 1 2 3; do
  curl -s -X POST localhost:8787/v1/sessions/$SID/_test_emit \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"text\":\"event-$i\"}"
done

# 2. SSE shows id:1 / id:2 / id:3 events.
curl -N localhost:8787/v1/sessions/$SID/events/stream
# (Ctrl-C to stop)

# 3. Hard-kill the server. (Or `docker compose down --no-stop` then `up`.)
docker kill -s SIGKILL oma-server

# 4. Restart.
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

# 5. Reconnect SSE with the last seen seq — only events after seq 3 stream.
curl -N -H 'Last-Event-ID: 3' localhost:8787/v1/sessions/$SID/events/stream
# Or `Last-Event-ID: 0` to replay everything.
```

The same demo works on the Postgres compose unchanged.

| Cron / queue handlers | ✗  CF-only (P3 will land scheduler abstraction) |

## Sandbox isolation modes

| Mode | Use when | Configuration |
|---|---|---|
| `LocalSubprocessSandbox` (default) | Local dev, trusted agent code | Nothing — host subprocess in `./data/sandboxes/<sessionId>/`. `SANDBOX_PROVIDER=subprocess` (the default). |
| `DaytonaSandbox` | Production / untrusted code with managed VMs | `SANDBOX_PROVIDER=daytona`, `DAYTONA_API_KEY=...`, optional `DAYTONA_API_URL` (self-hosted) and `SANDBOX_IMAGE=node:22-slim`. Vault CA uploaded into the box on first exec; memory mount via `MEMORY_S3_*` env vars (s3fs installed by the adapter). |
| `LiteBoxSandbox` | Local hardware isolation without docker | `SANDBOX_PROVIDER=litebox`, optional `LITEBOX_MEMORY_MIB`, `LITEBOX_CPUS`, `SANDBOX_IMAGE`. BoxLite ships its own Firecracker runtime (no daemon). Memory mounts work via host bind-mount; vault CA copied into VM on first exec. |
| `E2BSandbox` | Firecracker microVM SaaS | `SANDBOX_PROVIDER=e2b`, `E2B_API_KEY=...`, optional `SANDBOX_IMAGE` (template id). Memory via `MEMORY_S3_*` env vars (same s3fs setup as Daytona). Outbound vault CA upload requires a template that allows `sudo` writes to `/etc/ssl/`. |
| `BoxRunSandbox` | Remote BoxLite REST endpoint (no KVM on the OMA host) | `SANDBOX_PROVIDER=boxrun`, `BOXRUN_URL=http://host:8100/v1/default`, optional `BOXRUN_TOKEN`. No mount primitive — bake a custom image with s3fs preinstalled if you need `/mnt/memory`. |
| `CloudflareSandbox` | If you happen to deploy on CF Workers + Containers | Use the regular `apps/agent` worker, not main-node. |

### Per-provider capability matrix

| Provider | bash | fs | net | `/mnt/memory` | `/mnt/outputs` | vault CA | workspace backup |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `LocalSubprocess` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (real symlink at /mnt/memory inside the container; falls back to workdir-relative `.mnt/memory` when /mnt isn't writable) | ✓ (same pattern) | ✓ | ✓ (tar+upload to BlobStore) |
| `LiteBox` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (host bind-mount via SimpleBox volumes) | ✓ | ✓ (CA copyIn on first exec) | ✓ (tar via exec + readFileBytes) |
| `Daytona` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (s3fs, requires `MEMORY_S3_*`) | ✓ (single-bucket layout: outputs under `session-outputs/<tenant>/<session>/`) | ✓ (CA upload on box create) | ✓ (tar via exec + readFileBytes) |
| `E2B` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (s3fs, requires `MEMORY_S3_*` + template with s3fs) | ✓ (same bucket, session-outputs prefix) | ⚠ (template must allow sudo writes to /etc/ssl/) | ✓ (tar via exec + readFileBytes) |
| `BoxRun` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ (HTTP API has no mount primitive — use a custom image with s3fs preinstalled) | ✗ (same — no host-bind primitive) | ✓ (CA upload via tar PUT) | ⚠ (best-effort tar via exec) |
| `CloudflareSandbox` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (R2 + FUSE) | ✓ | ✓ (interceptHttps + outboundHandlers) | ✓ (squashfs to R2 backup bucket) |

Read-only memory mounts: enforced via `chmod -R a-w` on the mount target where supported (LocalSubprocess, Daytona, E2B). LiteBox honors the `readOnly` flag on its volume mount. CloudflareSandbox does not enforce ro at the FS layer — the harness's write tool checks `assertWritable` and refuses writes regardless of provider.

## Vault credential injection (oma-vault sidecar)

When the sandbox's bash runs `curl https://api.github.com/...`, OMA injects
the matching vault credential as an `Authorization: Bearer ...` header
without ever exposing the token to the agent process. This mirrors the CF
build's `outboundByHost` + `MAIN_MCP.outboundForward` zero-trust pattern.

How it works:

```
sandbox bash
  ├── HTTPS_PROXY=http://oma-vault:14322
  ├── NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/app/data/oma-vault-ca/ca.crt
  ├── SSL_CERT_FILE=/app/data/oma-vault-ca/ca.crt
  └── curl https://api.github.com/user
              │
              ▼
       oma-vault (mockttp HTTPS MITM proxy)
       ├── Strip incoming Authorization (zero-trust)
       ├── Look up credential matching api.github.com host
       ├── Inject Authorization: Bearer <vault token>
       └── Forward to upstream
                  │
                  ▼
           api.github.com  ← sees real Authorization header
```

Set up:

```bash
# 1. Create a vault.
VID=$(curl -s -X POST localhost:8787/v1/vaults \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"github-prod"}' | jq -r .id)

# 2. Add a static_bearer credential bound to api.github.com.
curl -s -X POST localhost:8787/v1/vaults/$VID/credentials \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "display_name":"github-pat",
    "auth":{
      "type":"static_bearer",
      "token":"ghp_xxx",
      "mcp_server_url":"https://api.github.com"
    }
  }'

# 3. Run an agent. Its bash `curl https://api.github.com/user` will see
#    the credential injected; the model never sees the raw token.
```

The CA at `./data/oma-vault-ca/ca.crt` is regenerated on first vault
start and persisted across restarts. Sandboxes mounted with the shared
`./data` volume pick it up automatically through `OMA_VAULT_CA_CERT`.

  - `EventLogRepo`+`StreamRepo` — per-session event durability
  - `SandboxExecutor` — code execution sandbox (CF / E2B / subprocess)
  - `ToMarkdownProvider` — web_fetch HTML→md (Workers AI / turndown)
  - `TenantDbProvider` — per-tenant DB resolution

Each port has a Cloudflare adapter and a Node adapter. The Node entry
wires the Node adapters; the CF entry wires the CF adapters. Business
code (routes, harness, store services) is the same on both.

## Console UI

The same `apps/console` build that ships with CF prod talks to main-node.
Auth path is `/auth/*` (matches CF), data routes are `/v1/*`. Cookie auth
via better-auth.

**Two ways to serve it:**

### Single port (production / `docker compose up`)

The main-node Docker image embeds `apps/console/dist` and main-node's
`serveStatic` middleware mounts it at `"*"` with index.html SPA fallback.
Open `http://localhost:8787` and you get the Console — same port as the
API. CF prod has the equivalent via the `ASSETS` binding; same UX,
different mechanism.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
open http://localhost:8787
```

To skip the console build (smaller API-only image, ~250MB → ~245MB):

```bash
docker build -f apps/main-node/Dockerfile --build-arg SKIP_CONSOLE=1 \
  -t openma/main-node:api-only .
# then unset CONSOLE_DIR in your runtime env
```

### Vite dev server (development)

Hot-reload on console source changes. main-node still runs separately
on 8787; vite proxies `/v1` + `/auth` to it.

```bash
# Terminal 1: main-node
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
  PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 \
  pnpm --filter @open-managed-agents/main-node start

# Terminal 2: console (Vite dev server, proxies /v1 + /auth → :8787)
VITE_API_TARGET=http://localhost:8787 pnpm dev:console
# → http://localhost:5173

# Terminal 3 (optional): oma-vault — outbound credential injection
DATABASE_PATH=$(pwd)/data/oma.db OMA_VAULT_CA_DIR=$(pwd)/data/oma-vault-ca \
  pnpm --filter @open-managed-agents/oma-vault start
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` (dev) or `http://localhost:8787` (docker),
sign up via email + password. The verification OTP is printed to
main-node's stdout — paste into the console verify-signup screen.
Operators wiring real email replace the `sendVerificationOTP` callback

### CMDB MCP Knowledge Connector (Internal Infrastructure)

Self-host deployments can connect to internal CMDB instances (such as `https://10.0.21.209`) through the `oma-cmdb-mcp` sidecar container.

#### 1. Setup & Credentials
1. Save the CMDB CA certificate to `./secrets/cmdb-ca.crt`:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p secrets
   openssl s_client -connect 10.0.21.209:443 -showcerts </dev/null 2>/dev/null \
     | awk '/BEGIN CERTIFICATE/,/END CERTIFICATE/{print}' > secrets/cmdb-ca.crt
   ```
2. Configure `.env`:
   ```bash
   CMDB_BASE_URL=https://10.0.21.209
   CMDB_API_TOKEN=your-cmdb-api-token
   ```
3. Start the stack:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d oma-cmdb-mcp
   ```

#### 2. Security Boundary
- **Token Isolation**: `CMDB_API_TOKEN` and the CA certificate exist **only** inside the `oma-cmdb-mcp` container.
- `oma-server` and agent sandboxes never see or store the raw token.
- Agents interact with the CMDB strictly via high-level MCP tool calls (`mcp__cmdb__get_entity`, `mcp__cmdb__search_entities`, `mcp__cmdb__get_relationships`).

#### 3. Attaching to Agents
Attach the CMDB MCP endpoint (`http://oma-cmdb-mcp:3910/mcp`) to any agent via Console UI or the helper script:
```bash
pnpm --filter @open-managed-agents/root tsx scripts/attach-cmdb-mcp.ts
```

in `apps/main-node/src/auth/config.ts` with a Resend / SES / SMTP call.

Endpoints main-node implements for the console:
- `/auth-info` (provider list)
- `/auth/*` (better-auth: sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, get-session, OTP)
- `/v1/me`, `/v1/me/tenants`
- `/v1/agents` CRUD, `/v1/sessions` CRUD + events + SSE stream
- `/v1/memory_stores` + `/memories` + per-session bindings
- `/v1/vaults` + `/credentials`
- `/v1/model_cards` CRUD (+ `/key` for cleartext; capability probe on create)
- `/v1/environments` CRUD (+ archive). Node persists the environment config,
  but currently runs sessions in the local sandbox snapshot; environment
  package lists are not installed automatically at warmup yet.
- `/v1/models/list` (GET catalog stub + POST provider key probe)
- `/v1/integrations/{linear,github,slack}/{installations,publications,...}` — read + persona/capability PATCH + dispatch-rule CRUD. Active when `PLATFORM_ROOT_SECRET` env var is set. Publication-create endpoints (`start-a1`, `credentials`, `handoff-link`, `personal-token`) now run in-process via `NodeInstallBridge.startInstallation` — wire shape matches the CF gateway verbatim. The OAuth callback / setup-page / webhook / Linear MCP / GitHub refresh-by-vault routes are all in-process via `buildIntegrationsGatewayRoutes`.

Endpoints stubbed (return empty `data: []` so the UI degrades gracefully):
- `/v1/api_keys`, `/v1/me/cli-tokens`,
  `/v1/runtimes`, `/v1/skills`

These pages render an "empty" state in the console; their CF counterparts
will land in main-node as follow-up work.

### Integrations on self-host

The Node read + write side comes online automatically when
`PLATFORM_ROOT_SECRET` is set. The schema (linear_*, github_*, slack_*
tables) is created on boot via `applyIntegrationsSchema`. Webhook-events
retention sweep also runs every minute (cron-gated to 04:00 UTC) when
the schema is present.

What this gets you:
- Console can list / patch / unpublish existing publications and dispatch
  rules.
- Linear / GitHub / Slack OAuth callbacks land directly on main-node
  (`/linear/oauth/...`, `/github/install/...`, `/slack/oauth/...`,
  `/<provider>-setup/<token>`). The provider implementations from
  `packages/{linear,github,slack}` run in-process via `NodeInstallBridge`.
- Webhook receivers (`/linear/webhook/...`, `/github/webhook/...`,
  `/slack/webhook/...`) verify HMAC signatures via the same provider
  code path the CF gateway uses. When a verified webhook lands on a
  session bound to the publication (Linear comment-reply, GitHub
  per_issue PR comment, Slack thread reply), `NodeInstallBridge`'s
  in-process `SessionCreator.resume` synthesizes a `user.message`
  event and appends it to the session via the same `NodeSessionRouter`
  the public `POST /v1/sessions/:id/events` route uses — the harness
  wakes up automatically.
- The Linear MCP escape-hatch route (`POST /linear/mcp/:sessionId`)
  proxies `linear_graphql` calls with the per-session bearer.
- GitHub `refresh-by-vault` (`POST /github/internal/refresh-by-vault`)
  mints fresh installation tokens via App-JWT and rotates the static_bearer
  + cap_cli vault credentials in place.
- Linear cron dispatch (auto-pickup of issues) is exposed to the Node
  scheduler via `linearDispatchTick` from
  `@open-managed-agents/scheduler/jobs/linear-dispatch`.

Required env on the Node side: `PLATFORM_ROOT_SECRET` (at-rest encryption
for OAuth tokens), `INTEGRATIONS_INTERNAL_TOKEN` (gates
`/github/internal/*`), `GATEWAY_ORIGIN` (public origin handed to providers
as redirect_uri / webhook URL — defaults to `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`). Provider
client_id / client_secret pairs go on the App row at install time, not in
env. CF stays unchanged: same gateway worker, same INTEGRATIONS service
binding, same shared INTEGRATIONS_DB.

`/billing-api/*` and `/v1/internal/usage_events` are CF-only by design
(both call out to a `USAGE_METER` worker that lives in a separate repo).
Self-host operators run their own metering or skip the billing pipeline.

## Production hardening (what's NOT in the PoC)

If you take this past trusted-dev territory, you'll want:

  - **Real auth.** Today every request is `tenant_id="default"`. Wire
    better-auth + the `auth.ts` middleware that apps/main uses.
  - **E2B (or equivalent) sandbox.** `LocalSubprocessSandbox` is a
    `chmod 777` on your host — fine for trusted dev, deadly for an agent
    a stranger can prompt-inject.
  - **Backups.** SQLite + ./data is one host. `litestream` to S3 covers
    point-in-time recovery; for higher durability, swap to Postgres.
  - **Observability.** No Analytics Engine equivalent yet. Pipe
    `pino` stdout into Loki / Grafana / your shipper of choice.
